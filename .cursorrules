Don't run the application, I will test by myself.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Always use (activate) it when doing python development. First, to check whether 'uv' is available, use `which uv`. If that's the case, first activate the venv, and then use `uv pip install` to install packages. Otherwise, fall back to `pip`.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When searching for recent news, use the current year (2025) instead of previous years, or simply use the "recent" keyword to get the latest information
- In @chakra-ui/icons, `forwardRef` should be imported directly from 'react', not from '@chakra-ui/react'
- When initializing YouTube iframe API, implement a robust loading strategy with checks for API availability, container existence, and error handling to avoid blank players on first page load
- For @tanstack/react-router route changes, use 'onResolved' as the subscription event name when tracking route changes to properly update sidebar navigation state
- When implementing dark mode with Chakra UI, always use `useColorModeValue` for all colors instead of hardcoded values to ensure proper theme switching and consistent appearance across light and dark modes
- For internationalization (i18n) in React, use the useLanguage hook with the t() function to translate all UI text. Structure translation keys hierarchically (e.g., 'profile.editProfile') to maintain organization and clarity across different language files. Implement language switching through the LanguageSwitcher component and ensure all new UI text is added to all language translation files to maintain consistency.
- When rendering HTML in translated text with i18n, use dangerouslySetInnerHTML with a Box component instead of directly using Text component. Create a utility function renderHtmlTranslation for consistency across the application.
- For TypeScript projects, configure ESLint to automatically fix unused imports and variables by using the 'unused-imports' plugin with appropriate rules. Set '@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars' to 'off' and let the plugin handle unused variables. For React components with unused parameters, add a console.log statement or prefix with underscore to avoid TypeScript errors.
- When using SQLAlchemy with Pydantic in FastAPI, ensure database connection URLs are returned as strings, not as Pydantic's MultiHostUrl objects. SQLAlchemy's create_engine function expects a string URL, not a URL object. Use f-strings to format the database URL instead of using MultiHostUrl.build().
- When encountering issues with Chakra UI Select component, use a native HTML select element wrapped in a styled Box component instead. Import useColorModeValue from "@/components/ui/color-mode" (not from "@chakra-ui/react") to ensure proper theming, and add appropriate styling to match other form elements. Also, when using Chakra UI's Button component, use "colorScheme" instead of "colorPalette" for color variants.
- When handling API errors in a full-stack application, implement error handling at multiple levels: 1) Backend should detect and classify specific error types (e.g., quota limits, authentication issues), 2) API responses should include structured error information with clear codes and messages, 3) Frontend should display user-friendly error messages with appropriate UI treatments, and 4) Add retry mechanisms for transient errors. For third-party API errors like Google Gemini API quota limits, provide specific guidance to users on how to resolve the issue.
- When implementing database migrations in a SQLAlchemy/SQLModel application, ensure you run the migration in the context of the virtual environment (use `source .venv/bin/activate` before running `python -m alembic upgrade head`). Also implement graceful fallbacks in the frontend for cases where the database schema might not be fully up-to-date, especially during rolling deployments or when multiple servers are being updated sequentially.
- When fixing browser extension authentication issues: 1) In Manifest V3, "host_permissions" should not be in the permissions array (it's a separate top-level field), 2) Add "storage" permission for chrome.storage.local API usage, 3) Extension authentication endpoints should handle unauthenticated requests gracefully and return proper JSON responses with meaningful error messages, 4) Use proper dependency injection for authentication but don't require it for extension auth endpoints, 5) Import TokenPayload from models module, not from security module.
- When implementing robust YouTube transcript API error handling: 1) Import all specific exceptions from youtube_transcript_api._errors, 2) Handle xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError for empty XML responses from YouTube, 3) Implement retry logic with multiple language combinations (["en"], ["en-US", "en-GB"], ["zh-CN", "zh-TW"], etc.), 4) Distinguish between permanent failures (VideoUnavailable, InvalidVideoId) that shouldn't retry and transient failures (CouldNotRetrieveTranscript) that should try other language combinations, 5) Provide user-friendly error messages explaining possible causes like missing captions or disabled transcripts.
- When encountering YouTube transcript API issues like "no element found: line 1, column 0" errors (XML parsing errors), consider switching to yt-dlp for more robust transcript extraction. yt-dlp is more stable and handles YouTube's changes better than youtube-transcript-api. Implementation should: 1) Replace youtube-transcript-api dependency with yt-dlp in pyproject.toml, 2) Use yt-dlp with writesubtitles/writeautomaticsub options to download VTT subtitle files, 3) Parse VTT content manually to extract timestamps and text, 4) Handle both manual and automatic captions, 5) Try multiple language combinations with preference ordering, 6) Use temporary directories for subtitle file downloads, 7) Maintain the same API interface to avoid breaking existing code.
- When replacing hardcoded values with environment variables in a Vite React project: 1) Use VITE_ prefix for environment variables to be accessible in frontend code, 2) Update vite-env.d.ts to include proper TypeScript definitions for the env variables, 3) Ensure tsconfig.json includes *.d.ts files in the include array for TypeScript to recognize type definitions, 4) For dynamic script loading like GA4, implement async initialization functions that check environment variables before loading external scripts, 5) Replace hardcoded values in both HTML and TypeScript files with import.meta.env references.
- **FastAPI OAuth2 Login Form Data Fix**: When implementing login with FastAPI OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, the frontend must send form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded), not JSON. Convert login request body to URLSearchParams: `const formData = new URLSearchParams(); formData.append('username', email); formData.append('password', password);` then send as `data: formData.toString()`. The backend expects form fields, not JSON objects, despite the service having correct Content-Type headers.
- **Admin User Password Consistency**: When creating admin users in database reset/seeding scripts, always use environment variables (settings.FIRST_SUPERUSER and settings.FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD) instead of hardcoded values. Use get_password_hash() to properly hash the password from the environment variable. This ensures consistency between different initialization methods (reset_db.py vs initial_data.py) and prevents login issues where the actual password doesn't match the expected environment variable.

- DialogRoot doesn't support `size` or `placement` props
- DialogTrigger needs `onClick` handler, not `asChild`
- Checkbox uses `onChange` with `e.target.checked`, not `onCheckedChange`
- Button uses `htmlType` for form submission, not `type`
- DialogCloseTrigger needs `onClick` handler, not `asChild`
- Delete components should accept full objects (user/item) not just IDs
- ItemsService.deleteItem uses `{ id: string }` parameter
- UsersService.deleteUser uses `{ userId: string }` parameter

**Status**: 🎉 **MIGRATION COMPLETE** - 100% error reduction achieved, 0 errors remaining!
**Final Result**: Successfully migrated entire frontend from Chakra UI to Ant Design with full TypeScript compatibility

- ✅ **Backend Config Update**: Updated FRONTEND_HOST from localhost:8000 to localhost:8001 in backend/app/core/config.py
- ✅ **Frontend Proxy Config**: Updated proxy target from localhost:8000 to localhost:8000 in frontend/config/proxy.ts
- ✅ **Frontend Request Config**: Updated baseURL from localhost:8002 to localhost:8000 in frontend/src/app.tsx
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Created .env file with BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS="http://localhost:8001,http://localhost:8000"
- ✅ **Final Port Setup**: Backend should run on port 8000, Frontend should run on port 8001
- ✅ **CORS Alignment**: Backend configured to allow requests from frontend on port 8001

**Current Port Configuration**:
- Backend: localhost:8000
- Frontend: localhost:8001
- API Communication: Frontend → Backend on port 8000
- CORS: .env file allows both ports 8001 and 8000

## FastAPI Login Form Data Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem**: Login endpoint was returning validation errors: `{"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["body","username"],"msg":"Field required"},{"type":"missing","loc":["body","password"],"msg":"Field required"}]}`

**Root Cause**: Frontend was sending JSON data with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` Content-Type, but FastAPI OAuth2PasswordRequestForm expects actual form data.

**Solution Applied**:
1. ✅ **Fixed Login Service**: Modified `frontend/src/services/ant-design-pro/login.ts` to convert JSON body to URLSearchParams form data

- ✅ **Input Pattern**: AntdInput with size="middle" and proper registration
- ✅ **Button Pattern**: Button with htmlType="submit" and loading states
- ✅ **Styled Components**: Use styled-components for layout and custom styling
- ✅ **Delete Components**: Use item/user object props instead of id strings

**Key Lessons Learned**:
- Field component doesn't support `invalid` prop, only `errorText`
- DialogRoot doesn't support `size` or `placement` props
- DialogTrigger needs `onClick` handler, not `asChild`
- Checkbox uses `onChange` with `e.target.checked`, not `onCheckedChange`
- Button uses `htmlType` for form submission, not `type`
- DialogCloseTrigger needs `onClick` handler, not `asChild`
- Delete components should accept full objects (user/item) not just IDs
- ItemsService.deleteItem uses `{ id: string }` parameter
- UsersService.deleteUser uses `{ userId: string }` parameter

**Status**: 🎉 **MIGRATION COMPLETE** - 100% error reduction achieved, 0 errors remaining!
**Final Result**: Successfully migrated entire frontend from Chakra UI to Ant Design with full TypeScript compatibility

## FastAPI Login Form Data Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem**: Login endpoint was returning validation errors: `{"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["body","username"],"msg":"Field required"},{"type":"missing","loc":["body","password"],"msg":"Field required"}]}`

**Root Cause**: Frontend was sending JSON data with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` Content-Type, but FastAPI OAuth2PasswordRequestForm expects actual form data.

**Solution Applied**:
1. ✅ **Fixed Login Service**: Modified `frontend/src/services/ant-design-pro/login.ts` to convert JSON body to URLSearchParams form data
2. ✅ **Added Missing Types**: Added `LoginParams` and `LoginResult` types to `typings.d.ts`
3. ✅ **Updated Login Page**: Modified login page to handle token response correctly and store JWT token
4. ✅ **Fixed Request Interceptor**: Ensured token is stored with key 'token' to match request interceptor
5. ✅ **Mock Captcha Function**: Added mock captcha function for mobile login demo

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Convert JSON body to form data
const formData = new URLSearchParams();
formData.append('username', body.username);
formData.append('password', body.password);
// Send as form data string
data: formData.toString()
```

**Test Results**:
- ❌ Before: `curl` with JSON data → `{"detail": "Field required"}`
- ✅ After: `curl` with form data → `{"access_token": "eyJ...", "token_type": "bearer"}`

**Credentials**: 
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `changethis` (from .env file)

**Status**: 🎉 **RESOLVED** - Login authentication is now working correctly with proper form data handling

**Migration Status Update**:
- ✅ **MIGRATION COMPLETE**: 100% error reduction achieved, 0 TypeScript errors
- ✅ **RUNTIME FIXES COMPLETE**: All styling props and component compatibility issues resolved
- ✅ **BACKEND-FRONTEND INTEGRATION COMPLETE**: Full authentication flow working
- ✅ **LOGIN AUTHENTICATION FIXED**: OAuth2 form data issue resolved

**Final Architecture**:
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy running on port 8000
- **Frontend**: Ant Design Pro + React running on port 8001  
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with proper form data OAuth2 flow
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper user management
- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests between ports
