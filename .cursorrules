Don't run the application, I will test by myself.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Always use (activate) it when doing python development. First, to check whether 'uv' is available, use `which uv`. If that's the case, first activate the venv, and then use `uv pip install` to install packages. Otherwise, fall back to `pip`.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When searching for recent news, use the current year (2025) instead of previous years, or simply use the "recent" keyword to get the latest information
- In @chakra-ui/icons, `forwardRef` should be imported directly from 'react', not from '@chakra-ui/react'
- When initializing YouTube iframe API, implement a robust loading strategy with checks for API availability, container existence, and error handling to avoid blank players on first page load
- For @tanstack/react-router route changes, use 'onResolved' as the subscription event name when tracking route changes to properly update sidebar navigation state
- When implementing dark mode with Chakra UI, always use `useColorModeValue` for all colors instead of hardcoded values to ensure proper theme switching and consistent appearance across light and dark modes
- For internationalization (i18n) in React, use the useLanguage hook with the t() function to translate all UI text. Structure translation keys hierarchically (e.g., 'profile.editProfile') to maintain organization and clarity across different language files. Implement language switching through the LanguageSwitcher component and ensure all new UI text is added to all language translation files to maintain consistency.
- When rendering HTML in translated text with i18n, use dangerouslySetInnerHTML with a Box component instead of directly using Text component. Create a utility function renderHtmlTranslation for consistency across the application.
- For TypeScript projects, configure ESLint to automatically fix unused imports and variables by using the 'unused-imports' plugin with appropriate rules. Set '@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars' to 'off' and let the plugin handle unused variables. For React components with unused parameters, add a console.log statement or prefix with underscore to avoid TypeScript errors.
- When using SQLAlchemy with Pydantic in FastAPI, ensure database connection URLs are returned as strings, not as Pydantic's MultiHostUrl objects. SQLAlchemy's create_engine function expects a string URL, not a URL object. Use f-strings to format the database URL instead of using MultiHostUrl.build().
- When encountering issues with Chakra UI Select component, use a native HTML select element wrapped in a styled Box component instead. Import useColorModeValue from "@/components/ui/color-mode" (not from "@chakra-ui/react") to ensure proper theming, and add appropriate styling to match other form elements. Also, when using Chakra UI's Button component, use "colorScheme" instead of "colorPalette" for color variants.
- When handling API errors in a full-stack application, implement error handling at multiple levels: 1) Backend should detect and classify specific error types (e.g., quota limits, authentication issues), 2) API responses should include structured error information with clear codes and messages, 3) Frontend should display user-friendly error messages with appropriate UI treatments, and 4) Add retry mechanisms for transient errors. For third-party API errors like Google Gemini API quota limits, provide specific guidance to users on how to resolve the issue.
- When implementing database migrations in a SQLAlchemy/SQLModel application, ensure you run the migration in the context of the virtual environment (use `source .venv/bin/activate` before running `python -m alembic upgrade head`). Also implement graceful fallbacks in the frontend for cases where the database schema might not be fully up-to-date, especially during rolling deployments or when multiple servers are being updated sequentially.
- When fixing browser extension authentication issues: 1) In Manifest V3, "host_permissions" should not be in the permissions array (it's a separate top-level field), 2) Add "storage" permission for chrome.storage.local API usage, 3) Extension authentication endpoints should handle unauthenticated requests gracefully and return proper JSON responses with meaningful error messages, 4) Use proper dependency injection for authentication but don't require it for extension auth endpoints, 5) Import TokenPayload from models module, not from security module.
- When implementing robust YouTube transcript API error handling: 1) Import all specific exceptions from youtube_transcript_api._errors, 2) Handle xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError for empty XML responses from YouTube, 3) Implement retry logic with multiple language combinations (["en"], ["en-US", "en-GB"], ["zh-CN", "zh-TW"], etc.), 4) Distinguish between permanent failures (VideoUnavailable, InvalidVideoId) that shouldn't retry and transient failures (CouldNotRetrieveTranscript) that should try other language combinations, 5) Provide user-friendly error messages explaining possible causes like missing captions or disabled transcripts.
- When encountering YouTube transcript API issues like "no element found: line 1, column 0" errors (XML parsing errors), consider switching to yt-dlp for more robust transcript extraction. yt-dlp is more stable and handles YouTube's changes better than youtube-transcript-api. Implementation should: 1) Replace youtube-transcript-api dependency with yt-dlp in pyproject.toml, 2) Use yt-dlp with writesubtitles/writeautomaticsub options to download VTT subtitle files, 3) Parse VTT content manually to extract timestamps and text, 4) Handle both manual and automatic captions, 5) Try multiple language combinations with preference ordering, 6) Use temporary directories for subtitle file downloads, 7) Maintain the same API interface to avoid breaking existing code.
- When replacing hardcoded values with environment variables in a Vite React project: 1) Use VITE_ prefix for environment variables to be accessible in frontend code, 2) Update vite-env.d.ts to include proper TypeScript definitions for the env variables, 3) Ensure tsconfig.json includes *.d.ts files in the include array for TypeScript to recognize type definitions, 4) For dynamic script loading like GA4, implement async initialization functions that check environment variables before loading external scripts, 5) Replace hardcoded values in both HTML and TypeScript files with import.meta.env references.

## Replace YouTube Transcript API with yt-dlp

[X] Analyze the problem with youtube-transcript-api (XML parsing errors)
[X] Update pyproject.toml to replace youtube-transcript-api with yt-dlp dependency
[X] Rewrite get_youtube_transcript function to use yt-dlp for subtitle extraction
[X] Implement VTT content parsing to extract timestamps and text
[X] Handle both manual and automatic captions with language preferences
[X] Test the new implementation successfully
[X] Update .cursorrules with lessons learned about yt-dlp implementation

The YouTube transcript API issue has been resolved by replacing youtube-transcript-api with yt-dlp:

1. **Dependency Update**: Replaced `youtube-transcript-api<1.0.0,>=0.6.1` with `yt-dlp<2025.0.0,>=2024.12.0` in pyproject.toml

2. **New Implementation**: Completely rewrote the `get_youtube_transcript` function to use yt-dlp:
   - Uses yt-dlp to download VTT subtitle files
   - Handles both manual and automatic captions
   - Supports multiple language preferences with fallback logic
   - Implements proper VTT content parsing with timestamp extraction

3. **Key Features**:
   - More robust and stable than youtube-transcript-api
   - Better handling of YouTube's changing API
   - Support for both quick_check and full processing modes
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Maintains same API interface for backward compatibility

4. **Test Results**: Successfully tested with video ID jNQXAC9IVRw, extracted 6 transcript entries with proper timestamps

The implementation resolves the "no element found: line 1, column 0" XML parsing errors that were occurring with the old youtube-transcript-api.

## Fix YouTube Transcript API Error Handling

[X] Examine the youtube_transcript_api library to understand the error better
[X] Improve error handling in get_youtube_transcript function  
[X] Add more specific error messages for different transcript API failures
[X] Add fallback or retry mechanisms for transient failures
[X] Update the frontend to show more helpful error messages

The YouTube transcript API error handling has been significantly improved:

1. **Specific Exception Handling**: Added handling for all youtube_transcript_api exceptions:
   - NoTranscriptFound, TranscriptsDisabled, VideoUnavailable
   - TooManyRequests, CouldNotRetrieveTranscript, InvalidVideoId
   - YouTubeRequestFailed, NoTranscriptAvailable
   - xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError (for empty XML responses)

2. **Multiple Language Fallbacks**: Implemented retry logic with different language combinations:
   - ["en", "zh", "es"] (original)
   - ["en"] (English only)
   - ["en-US", "en-GB"] (specific English variants)
   - ["zh-CN", "zh-TW"] (Chinese variants)
   - ["es", "pt", "fr"] (other common languages)

3. **Better Error Messages**: Updated error messages to be more user-friendly and informative, explaining possible causes like:
   - Video doesn't have captions/subtitles
   - Transcripts disabled by creator
   - Video is private or unavailable
   - YouTube temporarily blocking requests

4. **Smart Retry Logic**: Some errors (like VideoUnavailable, InvalidVideoId) immediately stop retrying since they won't succeed with different languages, while others (like CouldNotRetrieveTranscript) try other language combinations.

The specific error "no element found: line 1, column 0" was caused by YouTube returning empty XML responses, which is now properly handled with xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError catching.

## Fix API Response for Videos Without Transcripts

[X] Modified the mindmap creation endpoint to validate transcript availability upfront
[X] Added get_youtube_transcript import to the routes module  
[X] Changed behavior so API returns 400 error instead of 200 success when no transcript is available
[X] Added user-friendly error message explaining why the video can't be processed
[X] Added quick_check parameter for faster validation during API endpoint checks
[X] Updated background processing to use full language combination retry logic

Now when a video doesn't have transcripts, the API will return an HTTP 400 error with the message: "This video does not have transcripts/subtitles available. Please try with a different video that has captions enabled." instead of creating a "successful" mindmap with an error message.

The implementation uses a two-tier approach:
- **API Validation (quick_check=True)**: Fast validation with basic language combinations for immediate user feedback
- **Background Processing (quick_check=False)**: Full retry logic with all language combinations for comprehensive processing
